## Katana

#### This is a fork of Katana that includes the single fix for original issue 58 that fixes a null reference exception. The fix will not be officially backported to 3.0, so this is a patch of 3.0.1 that includes this single change.

#### Please do not use this if you aren't super sure this is what you need. I am not responsible if your world explodes as a result.
